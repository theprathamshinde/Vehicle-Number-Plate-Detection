Problem Statement:
To Build a model for detecting the number plate from vehicle image and recognizing the characters from it.The system will able to identify different plate forms, adjust to different lighting conditions, and guarantee recognition accuracy. 

Objectives:
1. To detect the number plate i.e area of interest from vehicle image.
2. Extract the number plate.
3. Apply Optical Character Recognition on extracted number plate.
